# 1.0.2

Renamed a folder from `docs` to `docs-output` so that `yarn` won't remove it in
it's clean step. [Tracking issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/3517)

# 1.0.0

First "real" release. If you were using a pre 1.0.0 version, this might still
work for you, but the API underwent a major refactor/rewrite. Please read the
documentation to make sure everything still works as expected.
